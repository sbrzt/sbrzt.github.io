 abstract = {A SKOS controlled vocabulary of the possible roles assumed by Aldo Moro during his lifetime. https://www.w3id.org/moro/voc/roles/ is the namespace of the vocabulary. Its preferred prefix is `mrv`. The naming convention `\prefix\:\element\\number Ì€does not strictly convey meaning per se, but it has been followed to avoid excessively long URIs. In order to understand the meaning of any concept, please refer to its respective documentation properties, such as `skos:prefLabel`. The vocabulary imports the Publication Roles Ontology (PRO, http://purl.org/spar/pro), in order to take advantage of its classes and properties, by aligning the class `mrv:Role` as a subclass of `pro:Role`.},
