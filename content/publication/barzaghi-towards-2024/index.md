abstract: In recent decades, the role of cultural heritage in disaster risk management
  has been increasingly recognized. However, it is challenging to put in place adequate
  risk management strategies against possible threats to heritage institutions and
  the artifacts they work to preserve, manage, and share with both academia and the
  general public. Challenges include methodological divergences between different
  communities of experts, an inadequate knowledge of the assets and the inability
  to evaluate their worth from a non-market perspective, a severe lack of knowledge
  sharing, a lack of communication between different disciplines involved in heritage
  risk assessment, and a lack of engagement with local stakeholders. The Heritage
  Risk Assessment Ontology (HeRO) was developed and re-engineered to standardize risk
  assessment procedures and manage complex heritage risk data in a FAIR-compliant
  format. In this contribution, its effectiveness is demonstrated by illustrating
  its re-engineered structure and an example scenario involving digital preservation.
  Future work involves increasing its descriptive capabilities and developing a more
  effective typification mechanism by expanding and aligning existing vocabularies.
