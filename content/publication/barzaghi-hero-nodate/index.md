abstract: In recent decades there has been a change in perspective towards risk assessment
  in cultural and environmental heritage. Despite the positive impact of heritage
  on various aspects of society, it is often neglected in disaster risk management,
  mostly due to lack of strategies in sharing common methodologies and process knowledge.
  The SIRIUS project, centered in Ravenna (Italy), aims to localize global disaster
  management guidelines applied to cultural and environmental heritage. In the context
  of SIRIUS, a pattern-based OWL 2 DL ontology called the Heritage Risk Assessment
  Ontology (HeRO) is being developed to standardize risk assessment procedures and
  manage complex heritage risk data. In this contribution, its effectiveness is demonstrated
  through an in-depth exposition of its modules and an example scenario, promising
  practical application in an upcoming web-based tool. Future work involves semantic
  expansion, alignment with other heritage risk assessment methodologies, and further
  testing.
