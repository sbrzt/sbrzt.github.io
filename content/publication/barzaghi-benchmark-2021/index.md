abstract: 'The dataset collects a series of values associated with a sample of 30
  digital editions, and based on some evaluation criteria for reviewing scholarly
  digital editions compiled by Patrick Sahle in collaboration with Georg Voegler and
  IDE (Institut f√ºr Dokumentologie und Editorik) members (Sahle 2014). In particular,
  the aspects that have been taken into consideration during the evaluation process
  are the following: Documentation (Documentation, Scholarly objectives, Mission focusing
  on the objectives, Documentation and associated texts); Audience (Mission, focusing
  on the audience); Representation (Representation of documents and texts); Data model
  (Data modelling); Browse; Search; Indices; Quality of the presentation; Metadata
  (Metadata for description of and interlinkage between objects in the edition); Identification
  (Identification and citation); Formats (Spin offs and export formats); OS-OA (Access
  to basic data, Rights and licences); Additional features; Each aspect (except for
  Audience and Data model) has been given a score between 0, 0.5, and 1, where: 0
  represents a value that witnesses either the total absence or the lack of quality
  of the edition in terms of that specific aspect; 0.5 represents a value that witnesses
  a suboptimal implementation of that specific aspect in the edition; 1 represents
  a value that witnesses an optimal implementation of that specific aspect in the
  edition.'
