 abstract = {This paper introduces KwicKwocKwac 1.0 (KwicKK), a web application designed to enhance the annotation and enrichment of digital texts in the humanities. KwicKK provides a user-friendly interface that enables scholars and researchers to perform semi-automatic markup of textual documents, facilitating the identification of relevant entities such as people, organizations, and locations. Key functionalities include the visualization of annotated texts using KeyWord in Context (KWIC), KeyWord Out Of Context (KWOC), and KeyWord After Context (KWAC) methodologies, alongside automatic disambiguation of generic references and integration with Wikidata for Linked Open Data connections. The application supports metadata input and offers multiple download formats, promoting accessibility and ease of use. Developed primarily for the National Edition of Aldo Moro's works, KwicKK aims to lower the technical barriers for users while fostering deeper engagement with digital scholarly resources. The architecture leverages contemporary web technologies, ensuring scalability and reliability. Future developments will explore user experience enhancements, collaborative features, and integration of additional data sources.},
