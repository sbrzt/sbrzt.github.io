abstract: One of the main goals of Open Science is to make research more reproducible.
  There is no consensus, however, on what exactly \"reproducibility\" is, as opposed
  for example to \"replicability\", and how it applies to different research fields.
  After a short review of the literature on reproducibility/replicability with a focus
  on the humanities, we describe how the creation of the digital twin of the temporary
  exhibition \"The Other Renaissance\" has been documented throughout, with different
  methods, but with constant attention to research transparency, openness and accountability.
  A careful documentation of the study design, data collection and analysis techniques
  helps reflect and make all possible influencing factors explicit, and is a fundamental
  tool for reliability and rigour and for opening the \"black box\" of research.
