abstract: A SKOS controlled vocabulary of the possible subjects covered in Aldo Moro's
  works. https://www.w3id.org/moro/voc/subjects/ is the namespace of the vocabulary.
  Its preferred prefix is `msv`. The naming convention `prefix:elementnumber Ì€does
  not strictly convey meaning per se, but it has been followed to avoid excessively
  long URIs. In order to understand the meaning of any concept, please refer to its
  respective documentation properties, such as `skos:prefLabel`.
