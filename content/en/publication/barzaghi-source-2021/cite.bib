 abstract = {A collection of the source codes used to automatically register the Digital Object Identifiers of the works published on the National Edition of Aldo Moro's works.

To start the program, fill in the blanks in the code (marked with '@') accordingly, then run `python doifier.py` in the command prompt, and select the HTTP method to run.},
