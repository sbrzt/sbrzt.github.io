abstract: A SKOS controlled vocabulary of the possible roles assumed by Aldo Moro
  during his lifetime. https://www.w3id.org/moro/voc/roles/ is the namespace of the
  vocabulary. Its preferred prefix is `mrv`. The naming convention `prefix:elementnumber
  Ì€does not strictly convey meaning per se, but it has been followed to avoid excessively
  long URIs. In order to understand the meaning of any concept, please refer to its
  respective documentation properties, such as `skos:prefLabel`. The vocabulary imports
  the Publication Roles Ontology (PRO, http://purl.org/spar/pro), in order to take
  advantage of its classes and properties, by aligning the class `mrv:Role` as a subclass
  of `pro:Role`.
