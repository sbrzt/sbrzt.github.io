abstract: 'This article explores how to create reproducible workflows for the 3D acquisition
  and digitisation of cultural heritage objects to ensure sustainability and reusability
  across various institutions. By addressing two main research questions, the paper
  proposes a workflow that involves the systematic acquisition, processing, and digitisation
  of cultural heritage artefacts. In particular, the workflow focuses on developing
  digital twins for cultural heritage settings and exhibitions and proposes baseline
  standards for both technical and interpretative aspects of digitisation. The workflow
  has been derived and tested on the pilot case of the temporary exhibition The Other
  Renaissance: Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World in the context of the
  CHANGES project. We reflect on the software and hardware equipment, the procedures
  and techniques to use, and the formats to adopt to comply with openness, accessibility,
  transparency, reproducibility, reusability and sustainability of the research workflow
  by backing on previous works on fostering reproducibility in research and improving
  the interoperability of 3D data across different systems. It highlights the necessity
  for transparent documentation of every step of the process, focusing on accountability
  and practices in the context of cultural heritage research. Finally, the article
  suggests improvements to enhance the sustainability of these kinds of workflows
  and discusses future directions for digitisation efforts and sharing research practices.'
