abstract: 'Our goal was to obtain the digital twin of the temporary exhibition \"The
  Other Renaissance: Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World\", to make it
  accessible online to users using various devices (from smartphones to VR headsets).
  We started with a preliminary assessment of the exhibition, focussing on possible
  acquisition constraints - time, space, and materials - and related solutions. Then,
  we proceeded with the creation of the digital twin by acquiring, processing, modelling,
  optimising, exporting, metadating, and uploading the exhibition. We adopted a hybrid
  use of two distinct acquisition techniques, i.e. structured light projection scanning
  and photogrammetry, to create new digital cultural heritage objects and environments,
  and we used open technologies, formats and protocols to make available the final
  digital product. We described the process to collect and curate bibliographical
  (meta)data of the exhibition and digital twin creation process to foster its findability,
  accessibility, interoperability and reusability.'
