 abstract = {This article explores how to create reproducible workflows for the 3D acquisition and digitisation of cultural heritage objects to ensure sustainability and reusability across various institutions. By addressing two main research questions, the paper proposes a workflow that involves the systematic acquisition, processing, and digitisation of cultural heritage artefacts. In particular, the workflow focuses on developing digital twins for cultural heritage settings and exhibitions and proposes baseline standards for both technical and interpretative aspects of digitisation. The workflow has been derived and tested on the pilot case of the temporary exhibition The Other Renaissance: Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World in the context of the CHANGES project. We reflect on the software and hardware equipment, the procedures and techniques to use, and the formats to adopt to comply with openness, accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, reusability and sustainability of the research workflow by backing on previous works on fostering reproducibility in research and improving the interoperability of 3D data across different systems. It highlights the necessity for transparent documentation of every step of the process, focusing on accountability and practices in the context of cultural heritage research. Finally, the article suggests improvements to enhance the sustainability of these kinds of workflows and discusses future directions for digitisation efforts and sharing research practices.},
