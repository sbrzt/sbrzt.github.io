abstract: As per the objectives of Project CHANGES, particularly its thematic sub-project
  on the use of virtual technologies for museums and art collections, our goal was
  to obtain a digital twin of the temporary exhibition on Ulisse Aldrovandi called
  “The Other Renaissance”, and make it accessible to users online. After a preliminary
  study of the exhibition, focusing on acquisition constraints and related solutions,
  we proceeded with the digital twin creation by acquiring, processing, modelling,
  optimising, exporting, and metadating the exhibition. We made hybrid use of two
  acquisition techniques to create new digital cultural heritage objects and environments,
  and we used open technologies, formats, and protocols to make available the final
  digital product. Here, we describe the process of collecting and curating bibliographical
  exhibition (meta) data and the beginning of the digital twin creation to foster
  its findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. The creation
  of the digital twin is currently ongoing.
