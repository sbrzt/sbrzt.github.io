    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">This work aims to define a series of reference models that would serve as a guide to the design and development of the National Edition of Aldo Moro&rsquo;s works. These models have been defined through a benchmarking process that is organized as follows: content analysis on a sample of 30 digital editions, evaluated on the basis of certain criteria defined in [Sahle 2014]; processing of the data gathered as a result of the content analysis, so as to extract the relevant information, and visualize it; review of the data processing results and consideration of the models that can be used as reference. The digital editions that meet the quality criteria taken into consideration are equipped with the following characteristics: their audience is composed of both domain experts and generic users; their documentation is rich and accurate; their content is described by a complete set of metadata; they and their single parts are citable and uniquely identifiable; their data model is geared towards interoperability and interlinking between its contents and the relevant resources already existing on the Web; they use visualization and storytelling tools so as to convey information intuitively; their information architecture is well-structured and easily navigated; their data and contents can be downloaded in many different formats; they take advantage of Open Source software and tools; finally, their contents are open and accessible to anyone.</p>
