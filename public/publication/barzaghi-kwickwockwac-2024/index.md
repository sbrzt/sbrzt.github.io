abstract: This paper introduces KwicKwocKwac 1.0 (KwicKK), a web application designed
  to enhance the annotation and enrichment of digital texts in the humanities. KwicKK
  provides a user-friendly interface that enables scholars and researchers to perform
  semi-automatic markup of textual documents, facilitating the identification of relevant
  entities such as people, organizations, and locations. Key functionalities include
  the visualization of annotated texts using KeyWord in Context (KWIC), KeyWord Out
  Of Context (KWOC), and KeyWord After Context (KWAC) methodologies, alongside automatic
  disambiguation of generic references and integration with Wikidata for Linked Open
  Data connections. The application supports metadata input and offers multiple download
  formats, promoting accessibility and ease of use. Developed primarily for the National
  Edition of Aldo Moro's works, KwicKK aims to lower the technical barriers for users
  while fostering deeper engagement with digital scholarly resources. The architecture
  leverages contemporary web technologies, ensuring scalability and reliability. Future
  developments will explore user experience enhancements, collaborative features,
  and integration of additional data sources.
