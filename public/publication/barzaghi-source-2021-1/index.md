abstract: A Python script used to convert introductions and historical-critical notes,
  prepared by researchers and curators, into PDF files. The `stylesheet.css` file
  is used to define the style of the PDF output. You will either need a `config.json`
  file containing some variables in order to make it work (such as your local path
  and the name of the directory containing the HTML essays), or write them directly
  into the code as variables.
