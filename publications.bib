	abstract = {As a result of the proliferation of 3D digitisation in the context of cultural heritage projects, digital assets and digitisation processes - being considered as proper research objects - must prioritise adherence to FAIR principles. Existing standards and ontologies, such as CIDOC-CRM, play a crucial role in this regard, but they are often over-engineered for the need of a particular application context, thus making their understanding and adoption difficult. Application profiles of a given standard - defined as sets of ontological entities drawn from one or more semantic artefacts for a particular context or application - are usually proposed as tools for promoting interoperability and reuse while being tied entirely to the particular application context they refer to. In this paper, we present an adaptation and application of an ontology development methodology, i.e. SAMOD, to guide the creation of robust, semantically sound application profiles of large standard models. Using an existing pilot study we have developed in a project dedicated to leveraging virtual technologies to preserve and valorise cultural heritage, we introduce an application profile named CHAD-AP, that we have developed following our customised version of SAMOD. We reflect on the use of SAMOD and similar ontology development methodologies for this purpose, highlighting its strengths and current limitations, future developments, and possible adoption in other similar projects.},

	title = {A Proposal for a FAIR Management of 3D Data in Cultural Heritage: The Aldrovandi Digital Twin Case},
	abstract = {In this article we analyse 3D models of cultural heritage with the aim of answering three main questions: what processes can be put in place to create a FAIR-by-design digital twin of a temporary exhibition? What are the main challenges in applying FAIR principles to 3D data in cultural heritage studies and how are they different from other types of data (e.g. images) from a data management perspective? We begin with a comprehensive literature review touching on: FAIR principles applied to cultural heritage data; representation models; both Object Provenance Information (OPI) and Metadata Record Provenance Information (MRPI), respectively meant as, on the one hand, the detailed history and origin of an object, and - on the other hand - the detailed history and origin of the metadata itself, which describes the primary object (whether physical or digital); 3D models as cultural heritage research data and their creation, selection, publication, archival and preservation. We then describe the process of creating the Aldrovandi Digital Twin, by collecting, storing and modelling data about cultural heritage objects and processes. We detail the many steps from the acquisition of the Digital Cultural Heritage Objects (DCHO), through to the upload of the optimised DCHO onto a web-based framework (ATON), with a focus on open technologies and standards for interoperability and preservation. Using the FAIR Principles for Heritage Library, Archive and Museum Collections [1] as a framework, we look in detail at how the Digital Twin implements FAIR principles at the object and metadata level. We then describe the main challenges we encountered and we summarise what seem to be the peculiarities of 3D cultural heritage data and the possible directions for further research in this field.},

	abstract = {In recent decades there has been a change in perspective towards risk assessment in cultural and environmental heritage. Despite the positive impact of heritage on various aspects of society, it is often neglected in disaster risk management, mostly due to lack of strategies in sharing common methodologies and process knowledge. The SIRIUS project, centered in Ravenna (Italy), aims to localize global disaster management guidelines applied to cultural and environmental heritage. In the context of SIRIUS, a pattern-based OWL 2 DL ontology called the Heritage Risk Assessment Ontology (HeRO) is being developed to standardize risk assessment procedures and manage complex heritage risk data. In this contribution, its effectiveness is demonstrated through an in-depth exposition of its modules and an example scenario, promising practical application in an upcoming web-based tool. Future work involves semantic expansion, alignment with other heritage risk assessment methodologies, and further testing.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the role of cultural heritage in disaster risk management has been increasingly recognized. However, it is challenging to put in place adequate risk management strategies against possible threats to heritage institutions and the artifacts they work to preserve, manage, and share with both academia and the general public. Challenges include methodological divergences between different communities of experts, an inadequate knowledge of the assets and the inability to evaluate their worth from a non-market perspective, a severe lack of knowledge sharing, a lack of communication between different disciplines involved in heritage risk assessment, and a lack of engagement with local stakeholders. The Heritage Risk Assessment Ontology (HeRO) was developed and re-engineered to standardize risk assessment procedures and manage complex heritage risk data in a FAIR-compliant format. In this contribution, its effectiveness is demonstrated by illustrating its re-engineered structure and an example scenario involving digital preservation. Future work involves increasing its descriptive capabilities and developing a more effective typification mechanism by expanding and aligning existing vocabularies.},

	abstract = {This article explores how to create reproducible workflows for the 3D acquisition and digitisation of cultural heritage objects to ensure sustainability and reusability across various institutions. By addressing two main research questions, the paper proposes a workflow that involves the systematic acquisition, processing, and digitisation of cultural heritage artefacts. In particular, the workflow focuses on developing digital twins for cultural heritage settings and exhibitions and proposes baseline standards for both technical and interpretative aspects of digitisation. The workflow has been derived and tested on the pilot case of the temporary exhibition The Other Renaissance: Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World in the context of the CHANGES project. We reflect on the software and hardware equipment, the procedures and techniques to use, and the formats to adopt to comply with openness, accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, reusability and sustainability of the research workflow by backing on previous works on fostering reproducibility in research and improving the interoperability of 3D data across different systems. It highlights the necessity for transparent documentation of every step of the process, focusing on accountability and practices in the context of cultural heritage research. Finally, the article suggests improvements to enhance the sustainability of these kinds of workflows and discusses future directions for digitisation efforts and sharing research practices.},

Among these, AI and machine learning have proven to be valid engagement and storytelling tools for museums, in particular for the creation of interactive chatbots and better customize visitor experience. This paper aims to reason about the possibilities of these existing tools, discussing their potential and limitations. The collection of visitor flow data within the museum and the interactive use of chatbots allow different levels of personalization of the visit. The real question is: how can an evolving AI tool be transformed into a storytelling tool that is in harmony with the museum's itinerary and allows for personalization but also respects the museum's own identity and peculiarities? These reflections are part of a research proposal for developing a chatbot to orient visitors within the museum, signaling works of potential interest. The application context is the National Museum of Ravenna, characterised by a vast and heterogeneous collection that is difficult to use.},

They are tools to enhance cultural heritage and to gather, in the same context, cultural goods that otherwise would never be exposed together. Their temporal limitation gives them the uniqueness of an event that will not be repeated. The exhibition "The Other Renaissance: Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World” was created to offer visitors a tour of an exceptional legacy of objects, some of which have never been exhibited before, combined with objects, works of art from several Italian museums, and digital installations that together tell the story of how the first generation of naturalists took their first steps into science as we know it today. To store this exhibition a photogrammetric and structured light scanner survey campaign was launched to acquire 3D objects. By leveraging a combination of 3D, LOD, and Semantic Web technologies, we propose to create a digital twin (intended as an aggregation of different information about real-world heritage objects) of Aldrovandi exhibitions, to create a new digital tool differentiated from the physical exhibition, but that could store all the information and objects exposed together physically.},

	abstract = {A series of Python scripts that have been used to process the documents in the National Edition of Aldo Moro's works.  In particular, the scripts are: recast.py, for refactoring the documents code, correcting possible errors, normalizing and finalizing resource URIs, and so on; TEIfy.py, for generating TEI documents from the HTML code. The TEI structure imitates the source code as closely as possible, and in addition integrates bibliographic metadata in the document header as well; PDFfy.py, for generating PDF documents from the HTML code. The PDF pagination and visualization is regulated by a CSS stylesheet (stylesheet.css); generate.py, for converting metadata into semantic statements collected in a knowledge base and organized on the basis of the standards defined in the data modelling phase; align.py, for integrating document markup in the knowledge base; main.py, for gathering and managing the functions defined in the other scripts; utils.py, for choosing which script to run and in which local directory. To start the program, run `python main.py` in the command prompt, then select the function you want to run and the directory you intend to use.

The digital editions that meet the quality criteria taken into consideration are equipped with the following characteristics: their audience is composed of both domain experts and generic users; their documentation is rich and accurate; their content is described by a complete set of metadata; they and their single parts are citable and uniquely identifiable; their data model is geared towards interoperability and interlinking between its contents and the relevant resources already existing on the Web; they use visualization and storytelling tools so as to convey information intuitively; their information architecture is well-structured and easily navigated; their data and contents can be downloaded in many different formats; they take advantage of Open Source software and tools; finally, their contents are open and accessible to anyone.},

	abstract = {L’Edizione nazionale delle opere di Aldo Moro è un’edizione critica, filologicamente avvertita e annotata, dei testi editi ed inediti dello statista, che punta non solo a fornire un prodotto culturale universalmente fruibile dai cittadini, ma anche a realizzare un nuovo standard per la ricerca nazionale e internazionale sulla comunicazione politica. L'Edizione è realizzata interamente su piattaforma digitale ed è interrogabile in modo selettivo secondo molteplici criteri differenti basati su elementi intertestuali e contestuali delle opere, individuati dai ricercatori che ne hanno curato l’annotazione e la metadatazione. L’obiettivo di questo documento è quello di descrivere il processo di modellazione dei dati dell’Edizione. In particolare, questo documento si concentra sulla presentazione dei modelli principalmente utilizzati per descrivere le informazioni testuali, contestuali, e bibliografiche delle opere. Sebbene si tratti di un processo di modellazione basato sulle particolari necessità informative del Comitato Scientifico e della comunità scientifica interessata alla vita e all’operato di Aldo Moro, altri individui possono beneficiare di questo documento, che definisce un esempio di modellazione concettuale facilmente replicabile anche in altri contesti accademici e progettuali.},
